# [work-at-microsoft](https://work-at-microsoft.wilsonl.in/jobs).wilsonl.in

A web server + client that searches for careers at Microsoft.
Faster and more precise than official website, and comes with a nice UI.
The result of a weekend project trying to find a better way to search.

## Features

- Uses bit fields to search for keywords very quickly, efficiently, and accurately
- All data is stored in a few MBs of memory as code&mdash;no database or storage required
- Runs only on Cloudflare Workers and WebAssembly for extremely fast, scalable performance
- Clean, responsive UI using vanilla JS and Microsoft Fabric design

## Comparison

This app allows the combining of simple filters to form advanced, precise queries.
Combined with the performance optimisations, it delivers far more filtered results in usually under a second.

On one of my random tests, searching for "machine learning researcher engineer" returned over 3000 results, while taking around 1 second.
Searching for "title:machine+learning|~title:researcher engineer"<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> gave 8 results in less than 50 milliseconds.

For a UI comparison, see the [screenshots folder](screenshots).

## Technical

### Data

All jobs available on careers.microsoft.com are scraped and transformed into an array of simpler JSON objects.
Each object represents a job, with fields describing some aspect of the job:

```json
{
  "ID": "19234",
  "title": "Azure Service Engineer",
  "description": "Hello world",
  "date": "2018-1-3",
  "location": "Redmond, Washington, United States"
}
```

The `title` and `location` fields are searchable. This means that their words have to be indexed using bit fields.

### Bit field

All words in a searchable field (not bit field) are combined to form a set of words.
A bit field of *n* bytes, where *n* is the amount of jobs, is created for each word in the field.
A bit is set to 1 if its corresponding job has the word in its field, otherwise it is set to 0.

A bit field has some advantages:

- Space efficient, as it can represent 8 jobs per byte
- Very fast, as searching involves bitwise vector operations, which can be even faster with SIMD
- 100% accurate compared to bloom filters
- Consistent performance compared to hash-based structures

Dedicated C code is used to do the bitwise operations (via WebAssembly),
with all the bit fields directly stored in code,
for extremely fast performance.

### Searching

Searching is done by looking for words in a field.
There are three modes for each word:

- require: the word must exist in the field
- contain: at least one word with this mode must exist in the field
- exclude: the word must not exist in the field

The results are generated by doing bitwise operations across multiple bit fields.
The general algorithm can be summarised as:

```c
result = (req_a & req_b & req_c & ...) & (con_a | con_b | con_c | ...) & ~(exc_a | exc_b | exc_c | ...)
```

Bits set in the resulting bit field are mapped to the job at their corresponding position.

### Cloudflare

This app only needs on back-end serice: a single JS script + accompanying WASM code.
It takes advantage of Cloudflare Workers technology:

- faster than a VM or container with less cold starts, as code is run on a V8 Isolate
- naturally distributed to the edge for very low latency, despite being dynamic code
- takes advantage of Cloudflare for SSL, caching, and protection
- no need to worry about scaling, networking, or servers

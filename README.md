# Edgesearch

Build a full text search API using Cloudflare Workers and WebAssembly.

Documentation is currently WIP.

## At a glance

## Features

- Uses an [inverted index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) and [compressed bit sets](https://roaringbitmap.org/) stored in [Cloudflare Workers KV](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/workers-kv/).
- Packing multiple index entries and documents allows storing 13.4 million [Wikipedia article titles](./demo/wiki/) with 2.3 million unique terms in 66 keys&mdash;no database or server required.
- Runs on Cloudflare Workers at edge locations with WebAssembly code for fast, scalable performance.

## Demos

Check out the [demo](./demo) folder for live demos with source code.

## Usage

### Get the CLI

[Windows](https://wilsonl.in/edgesearch/bin/0.0.2-windows-x86_64.exe) |
[macOS](https://wilsonl.in/edgesearch/bin/0.0.2-macos-x86_64) |
[Linux](https://wilsonl.in/edgesearch/bin/0.0.2-linux-x86_64)

### Build the worker

```bash
edgesearch build \
  --documents documents.txt \
  --document-terms terms.txt \
  --maximum-query-results 20 \
  --output-dir dist/worker/
```

### Deploy the worker

```bash
edgesearch deploy \
  --default-results default.txt \ 
  --account-id CF_ACCOUNT_ID \
  --account-email me@email.com \ 
  --global-api-key CF_GLOBAL_API_KEY \
  --name my-edgesearch \
  --output-dir dist/worker/ \
  --namespace CF_KV_NAMESPACE_ID \
  --upload-data
```

### Calling the API

A [client](./client/) for the browser is available for using a deployed Edgesearch worker:

```typescript
import * as Edgesearch from 'edgesearch-client';

type Document = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
};

const client = new Edgesearch.Client<Document>('my-edgesearch.me.workers.dev');
const query = new Edgesearch.Query();
query.add(Edgesearch.Mode.REQUIRE, 'world');
query.add(Edgesearch.Mode.CONTAIN, 'hello', 'welcome', 'greetings');
query.add(Edgesearch.Mode.EXCLUDE, 'bye', 'goodbye');
const results = await client.search(query);
```

## How it works

### Bit sets

Terms for each document are merged into a large set of possible search terms.
A bit set is created for each possible search term, and for each document with ID *n* containing the term, the bit set has its *n*th bit set.

Each bit set is compressed using Roaring Bitmaps. [CRoaring](https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/CRoaring) is used as the implementation for unserialising and operating on bit sets, which is compiled to WebAssembly.

### Searching

Searching is done by looking for terms in a document.
There are three modes for each term:

- require: the term must exist in the document
- contain: at least one term with this mode must exist in the document
- exclude: the term must not exist in the document

The results are generated by doing bitwise operations across multiple bit sets.
The general computation can be summarised as:

```c
result = (req_a & req_b & req_c & ...) & (con_a | con_b | con_c | ...) & ~(exc_a | exc_b | exc_c | ...)
```

Bits set in the resulting bit set are mapped to the entry at their corresponding positions.

### Cloudflare

The entire app runs off a single JavaScript script + accompanying WASM code. It does not need any database or server, and uses Cloudflare Workers. This allows for some cool features:

- Faster than a VM or container with less cold starts, as code is run on a V8 Isolate.
- Naturally distributed to the edge for very low latency.
- Takes advantage of Cloudflare for SSL, caching, and distribution.
- No need to worry about scaling, networking, or servers.
